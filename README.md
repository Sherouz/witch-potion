[**“Witch's Potion: A Spooky Halloween Mini-Game Built with Python OOP”**](https://dev.to/shahrouzlogs/witchs-potion-a-spooky-halloween-mini-game-built-with-python-oop-5090)

It explains:

* Game concept and flow
* Class design (`Potion`, `Apprentice`, `Game`)
* How to add fun effects like slow printing and suspense

## 💡 Educational Purpose

This project was created for **quick practice of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **function design** in Python, wrapped in a fun Halloween theme.

It demonstrates:

* **OOP Design:** Three small classes — `Potion`, `Apprentice`, and `Game` — to organize logic.
* **Encapsulation:** Each class handles its own responsibilities (data, input, or flow).
* **Simple Game Logic:** Randomization (`random.sample`) and input validation.
* **User Interaction:** Basic console I/O and visual pacing with `time.sleep` for cinematic effect.

## ✨ Key Features

🎃 **Quick Gameplay:** Finish a round in under a minute. 

💥 **Randomized Potion Combo:** Every game is different. 

🐸 **Fun Failure State:** Wrong combo? Enjoy your new life as a frog. 

😈 **Cinematic Feel:** Slow-printed dialogue for Halloween atmosphere. 

🧪 **Beginner-Friendly Code:** Perfect for learners practicing classes and functions.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The witch is gone — you have to recreate her potion before she returns!
2. Choose **3 ingredients** from the list shown (e.g., `1,3,5`).
3. The game will mix your potion...
4. If your combo matches the witch’s secret combo → You win! 🎉
5. If not → 💥 the potion explodes and you get turned into a frog 🐸

### Example Run:

```
🧙‍♀️  WITCH’S POTION  🧪
The witch is away... Can you brew her secret potion?

Pick 3 ingredients (comma separated, e.g., 1,3,5):

  1. Eye of Newt
  2. Frog Leg
  3. Pumpkin Seed
  4. Bat Wing
  5. Ghost Dust

👉 Your choice: 1,3,5

✨ Mixing your ingredients...
💨 The cauldron bubbles and hisses ominously...

💥 The potion EXPLODES! Wrong mix!
🧪 The secret combo was: Frog Leg, Ghost Dust, Bat Wing
🐸 The witch returns and turns you into a frog!
```
